### Contribution

To match Napkin's style, some fonts are required:

- [Latin Modern Sans](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern) - For `#blue_box`.
- [Hakgyoansim Bareonbatang](https://copyright.keris.or.kr/wft/fntDwnldView?fntGrpId=GFT202301120000000000002) - For Korean support.

You'd better have the following tools for a better contribution experience

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - General purpose editor.
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) - Write mathematics symbols outside Typst.
- [Typsi](https://github.com/RanolP/typsi) - If you like typst-y symbol names, use this espanso package.
