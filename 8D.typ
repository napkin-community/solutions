Consider $C_n=X without K_n$, which is open. $C= {C_n | n in NN}$.

$nothing = C_0 subset C_1 subset C_2 " " dots.c$.

For any finite subset of $C$, the union is some $C_n$, and every $C_n$ is not $X$. In short, $C$ doesn't have a finite subset which covers $X$.

Since $X$ is compact and $C$ doesn't have a finite subset which covers $X$, $C$ is not an open cover.

Thus $inter_(n in NN) K_n != nothing$. #sym.qed
